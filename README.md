## üéØ Milestone 4 Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Integrate the Chapa API to handle all payment processing for bookings, from initiation to verification and confirmation.

### ‚úÖ **Key Features Implemented**

1.  **‚úÖ Chapa API Integration**: Securely process payments using the `chapa-python` library.
2.  **‚úÖ Payment Model**: A dedicated `Payment` model in the database to track transaction status, amount, and reference IDs.
3.  **‚úÖ Payment Initiation Endpoint**: An API endpoint to start a transaction and generate a Chapa checkout URL.
4.  **‚úÖ Payment Verification Webhook**: A webhook to receive and verify payment status updates from Chapa in real-time.
5.  **‚úÖ Asynchronous Email Confirmation**: Celery task to send users a confirmation email upon successful payment without blocking the API response.

## üöÄ Payment Workflow

The payment process follows these steps:

1.  **Create a Booking**: A user first creates a booking for a listing via a `POST` request to `/api/bookings/`.
2.  **Initiate Payment**: The user then makes a `POST` request to `/api/bookings/{booking_id}/pay/`.
3.  **Redirect to Chapa**: The API returns a `checkout_url`. The user is redirected to this URL to complete the payment on Chapa's secure page.
4.  **Payment Verification**: Upon completion, Chapa sends a notification to our webhook (`/api/payments/verify/`). The system verifies the transaction status with Chapa.
5.  **Update Status & Send Email**: If the payment was successful, the booking and payment status are updated to `completed`, and a confirmation email is sent to the user.

## üìä API Endpoints for Payment

### **Primary Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                     | Authentication |
| :--- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings/{booking_id}/pay/` | Initiate payment for a booking. | Required       |
| `GET`  | `/api/payments/verify/`        | Verify payment (Chapa callback) | Public         |

### **Prerequisite Endpoint**

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                         | Authentication |
| :--- | :--------------- |:------------------------------------| :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings/` | Creates a booking to be paid for. | Required       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Testing Guide

### **1. Environment Setup**

**Important: Chapa API Key**

Create a `.env` file in the project root (`alx_travel_app_0x02/.env`) and add your Chapa Test Secret Key:

```bash
# .env
CHAPA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_CHAPA_TEST_SECRET_KEY
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure all required packages, including `chapa-python`, are installed:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Application**

You need to run two services in separate terminals: the Django development server and the Celery worker.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Django development server
python manage.py runserver
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: Start Celery worker
celery -A alx_travel_app worker -l info
```

### **4. Configure Email (Optional)**
For email confirmations to be sent, configure your email backend in `alx_travel_app/settings.py`. For development, you can use the console backend to print emails to the terminal:
```python
# alx_travel_app/settings.py
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

## üì∏ Payment Flow Demonstration (Required)

_Please replace the placeholders below with screenshots or logs that demonstrate a successful payment initiation, verification, and the resulting status update in the `Payment` model._

**(Placeholder for Screenshot 1: Initiating Payment)**
*Description: A screenshot of an API client (e.g., Postman) showing the `checkout_url` received after a `POST` request to `/api/bookings/{id}/pay/`.*

**(Placeholder for Screenshot 2: Chapa Payment Page)**
*Description: A screenshot of the user being redirected to the Chapa checkout page.*

**(Placeholder for Screenshot 3: Successful Verification Log)**
*Description: A log from the Celery worker or Django server showing the payment was successfully verified and the confirmation email task was triggered.*

**(Placeholder for Screenshot 4: Database Record Updated)**
*Description: A screenshot of the `Payment` table in the database (e.g., in DBeaver or Django admin), showing the record with a `completed` status.*

**(Placeholder for Screenshot 5: Confirmation Email in Console)**
